## JavaScript Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple JavaScript programs developed as part of the **MERN Full-Stack Developer** journey organized by the **Ostad** platform. These projects are designed to strengthen the foundational concepts of JavaScript through practical problem-solving.

### 📁 Project List

Each file demonstrates a specific concept or feature of JavaScript:

* `addition.js` – Performs addition of two or more numbers.
* `celciusToFarenheight.js` – Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
* `characterIncludes.js` – Checks if a specific word exists in a given sentence.
* `charAt.js` – Finds the character at a specified index in a string.
* `concatenate.js` – Concatenates two or more strings.
* `minuteToSecond.js` – Converts minutes into seconds.
* `multiplication.js` – Multiplies two or more numbers.
* `oddOrEven.js` – Determines if a number is odd or even.
* `positiveOrNegative.js` – Checks whether a number is positive or negative.
* `square.js` – Calculates the square of a number.

### 💻 Execution

You can run each script using Node.js from the terminal:

```bash
node filename.js
```

For example:

```bash
node characterIncludes.js
```

### 🎯 Purpose

These mini projects serve as practical exercises to:

* Practice JavaScript syntax and logic building.
* Learn how to interact with standard input and output.
* Prepare for more advanced topics in full-stack development using the MERN stack.

### 📚 Organized By

These exercises are part of the **MERN Full-Stack Developer** course by **Ostad**.
